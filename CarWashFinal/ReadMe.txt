Part 1: Summary
The goal of the program is to provide a simple, user-friendly interface for scheduling car wash services. The program allows the customer to enter their name, select a product (basic, deluxe, or premium wash), choose an appointment date and time, and view a summary of their order. The target audience for the program is anyone who needs to schedule a car wash.

The strengths of the program include its simple design and easy to use interface. The program also provides basic validation of the user's product selection and appointment information.

However, the program has some weaknesses that can be improved upon in the future. For example, the program does not provide validation for date and time inputs or would be able to check the availability of appointments on a given date and time, or provide the ability to modify an existing appointment. The program also does not store the customer's order information.

In the future, the program can be improved by adding features such as appointment scheduling and management, customer database management, and improved user experience through the use of UI.
